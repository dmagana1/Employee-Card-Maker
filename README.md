# Employee Profile Maker
This proejct was about creating a team profile that contains one Manager, three Engineers, and one Intern.  This application is a command line based application and will generate prompts for the user to input information about the team memebers. Once the information is complete and no more team memebers are needed to be created an HTML file will be created containing all the information that was inputed into the command line.
